Greetings, you found my github! My name is Maxwell Wang and I am currently a Computer Science major at the University of Delaware class of 2024 and aspiring to achieve more throughout my career.

<h1>My experiences:</h1>

C++, Java, Python, TypeScript, R, HTML, C, CSS, React.js, Node.js, JavaScript, Basic Knowledge of Git (Bash, Terminal and Github) Unity, Raspberry Pi and Assembly Language (ASM)

<h1>My main projects:</h1>

[UD Course Scheduler Frontend Website](https://github.com/UD-CISC275-S22/cis-scheduler-team-007)

<p>Written in TypeScript with React.js + Hooks by Maxwell Wang and two other undergraduate students, we were able to design a website that is able to generate a four-year plan for Computer Science/Information Science Majors. On our website, the clients are able to add, delete or change plans, schedules for each semester and each course per semester. </p>
 

[Competitive Programming Club](https://github.com/mwang840/CompetiveProgramming)

<p>Written in C++, every Tuesdays during the school semester, I attended Competitive Programming Club hosted by undergraduate students, and then practice solving real life problems via Codeforces.com a competitive programming website applying data structures throughout each problem.</p>


[Raspberry Pi Projects](https://github.com/mwang840/PiProjectsNScripts)

<p>Written in C, Assembly (ASM) language and in the future some Python and other Object-Oriented Programming languages, this project was influenced by Cameron Thacker who also made the Rasbperry Pi Scrips projects.</p>

[React in a Nutshell](https://github.com/mwang840/React-In-A-nutshell)

<p>Written in TypeScript with React.js + Hooks by Maxwell Wang, Joshua Strassle and Eric Toreki, we designed a website that describes what react hooks are and how the react hooks should be used properly when making a website which the client can see the description of react hooks and can click buttons to show React.js based memes</p>

[IShowSpeed](https://github.com/mwang840/IShowSpeed)
<p>Written in TypeScript (including some JavaScript files generating after running tsc speed.ts) the bot which implements Discord's API can currently execute basic commands such as multiplying, adding, subtracting, pinging and much more of IShowSpeeds traits. IShowSpeed is a youtuber who makes funny streams every day and plays a lot of games ranging from Talking Ben to FIFA. This bot is still in the works but will keep updating the bot and adding more commands.

<h2> I'm currently learning or will learn in the forseeable future</h2>

***C#, .NET framework, SQL, Go Language, Vue.js, Rust, Ruby, PHP and maybe more modern languages***
