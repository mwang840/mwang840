Greetings, you found my github! My name is Maxwell Wang and I am currently a Computer Science major at the University of Delaware class of 2024 with a concentration in Artificial Intelligence. 

<h1>My experiences:</h1>

C++, Java, Python, TypeScript, R, HTML, C, CSS, React.js, Node.js, JavaScript, Basic Knowledge of Git (Bash, Terminal and Github) Unity, Raspberry Pi and Assembly Language (ASM)

<h1>My main projects:</h1>

[UD Course Scheduler Frontend Website](https://github.com/UD-CISC275-S22/cis-scheduler-team-007)

<p>Written in TypeScript with React.js + Hooks by Maxwell Wang, Joshua Strassle and Eric Toreki, we were able to design a website that is able to generate a four-year plan for Computer Science/Information Science Majors. On our website, the clients are able to add, delete or change plans, scheldules for each semester and each course per semester. </p>
 

[Competitive Programming Club](https://github.com/mwang840/CompetiveProgramming)

<p>Written in C++, every Tuesdays during the school semester, I attended Competitive Programming Club hosted by undergraduate students, Jan Ahmed, Amani Kruga and
Leon Zhao. I then practice solving real life problems via Codeforces.com a competitive programming website applying data structures throughout each problem.</p>


[Raspberry Pi Projects](https://github.com/mwang840/PiProjectsNScripts)

<p>Written in C, Assembly (ASM) language and in the future some Python and other Object-Oriented Programming languages, this project was influenced by Cameron Thacker who also made the Rasbperry Pi Scrips projects. Currently has the Blackjack game (Written in C from CISC-210), Factorial of a Number (without recursion and multiplication), Displays the Initial M with purple lights, Displays a Red X on the pi screen, Clears the lights off the raspberry pi screen, Display blue lights on the pi (All written in Assembly/ASM language). Doubly-Linked-List (Written in C and currently a work in progress).</p>

[React in a Nutshell](https://github.com/mwang840/React-In-A-nutshell)

<p>Written in TypeScript with React.js + Hooks by Maxwell Wang, Joshua Strassle and Eric Toreki, we designed a website that describes what react hooks are and how the react hooks should be used properly when making a website. On our website the client can see the description of react hooks and can click buttons to show React.js based memes</p>

[IShowSpeed](https://github.com/mwang840/IShowSpeed)
<p>Written in TypeScript with the use of Discord.js libraries and Mongo Databases, a bot that implements Discord's API can currently execute basic commands such as multiplying, adding, subtracting, pinging and much more of IShowSpeeds traits. IShowSpeed is a youtuber who makes funny streams every day and plays a lot of games ranging from Talking Ben to FIFA. This bot is still in the works but will keep updating the bot and adding more commands.

<h2> I'm currently learning or will learn in the forseeable future</h2>

***C#, .NET framework, SQL, Go Language, Vue.js, Rust, Ruby, PHP and maybe more modern languages***
