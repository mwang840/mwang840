<h1>My main projects:</h1>

[UD Course Scheduler Frontend Website](https://github.com/UD-CISC275-S22/cis-scheduler-team-007)

<p>Written in TypeScript with React.js + Hooks by Maxwell Wang and two other undergraduate students, we were able to design a website that is able to generate a four-year plan for Computer Science/Information Science Majors. On our website, the clients are able to add, delete or change plans, schedules for each semester and each course per semester. </p>
 

[Competitive Programming Club](https://github.com/mwang840/CompetiveProgramming)

<p>Written in C++, every Tuesdays during the school semester, I attended Competitive Programming Club hosted by undergraduate students, and then practice solving real life problems via Codeforces.com a competitive programming website applying data structures throughout each problem.</p>


[Assembly Image Projects](https://github.com/mwang840/AssemblyProjects)

<p>Written in Assembly Language (ASM), this project displays select images including an X, M, and clears the lights on the Raspberry Pi.</p>

[React in a Nutshell](https://github.com/mwang840/React-In-A-nutshell)

<p>Written in TypeScript with React.js + Hooks by Maxwell Wang, Joshua Strassle and Eric Toreki, we designed a website that describes what react hooks are and how the react hooks should be used properly when making a website which the client can see the description of react hooks and can click buttons to show React.js based memes</p>


<h2> I'm currently learning or will learn in the forseeable future</h2>

***Go Language, Rust, Ruby, Haxe, Elixir***
<h2>I hope to also apply the languages that I have learned to various Computer Science Topics, such as Full-stack Development, Artificial Intelligence, Machine Learning, Game Development and App Development</h2>
