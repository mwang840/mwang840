<p>Written in C, Assembly (ASM) language and in the future some Python and other oop languages, this project was influenced by Cameron Thacker who also made the Rasbperry Pi Scrips projects. Currently has the Blackjack game (Written in C from CISC-210), Factorial of a Number (without recursion and multiplication), Displays the Initial M with purple lights, Displays a Red X on the pi screen, Clears the lights off the raspberry pi screen, Display blue lights on the pi (All written in Assembly/ASM language).
